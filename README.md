# E-Commerce UI Website

This is a fully responsive e-commerce website UI built using Next.js, designed to provide a seamless and interactive shopping experience. The project includes various pages such as the homepage, product details, cart, wishlist, about, billing, signup, and contact pages.

The UI includes interactive features like flash sales, best-selling products, categories, and the ability to increment or decrement product quantities using the `useState` hook in React.
